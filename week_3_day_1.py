# # Review
# create variables for the following :
# 1. age
age = 25 #interger variable
# 2. name
name = "John" #string variable
# 3. song
song = "happy birthday" #string variable
# 4. food
food = "apples" #string variables
# 5. number
number = 1000 #integer variables


# #now include the variables you just made print in the following...


# Once upon a time, there was a [age] old coder named [name].
#concatnation -- + signs around variables
print ("Once upon a time, there was a " + str(age) + " old coder named " + name + ".")
print ("There was a " + str(number) + " as well.")
# age and number in a sentence
print ("He is " + str(age) + " and has " + str(number) + ".")

date_of_birth = 2021
number2 = 123
number3 = 123.456
number4 = 123.33
number5 = 4555

print ("In " + str(date_of_birth) + " there were " + str(number2) + " babies born on September 10th and " + str(number5) + " babies born on September 9th. ")
print (f"The date of birth is {date_of_birth} and the number is {number2} and the number is {number3} and the number is {number4} and the number is {number5}. ")

# [name] liked to hum the song [song] while coding. It was so annoying that their teammates would throw [food] until [name] would stop singing.
